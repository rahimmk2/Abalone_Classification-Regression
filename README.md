# rahimmk2Abalone_Classification-Regression
This is a machine learning project that uses supervised learning techniques to classify the gender of abalone using logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier. The dataset used in this project is the Abalone Dataset, which is commonly used for regression and classification tasks in machine learning.

In addition to gender classification, this project also employs linear regression to predict the weight of the abalone based on their height. Hyperparameters tuning was also performed to optimize the performance of the logistic regression and KNN classifier.

To evaluate the performance of the classifiers, confusion matrices and classification report were used. The metrics used to evaluate the classifiers include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Dataset
The Abalone Dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains measurements of abalone, such as their gender, height, weight, and other physical characteristics.
